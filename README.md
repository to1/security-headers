Add security headers for laravel project

This is a middleware to include in your laravel project if you dont want to include you'r headers in index or configure httpacces.

A Middleware is basically a code that is executed on every request that acts as a bridge between a request and a response. So we can create a middleware that appends or removes headers on each request.


Copy the code from [header][Headers.php]
